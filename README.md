Basic forum software written in Clojure.

Work-in-progress.

## Demo

A demo instance of Clorum is available on [Heroku](https://clorum.herokuapp.com/).

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed, as well as MySQL or PostgreSQL (see "Database Servers" below for details).

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

The database structure can be found in `clorum-{database-server}.sql`, which can be easily imported into a database.

## Configuration

Clorum makes use of [yogthos/config](https://github.com/yogthos/config) to handle configuration. The default development profile can be found in `/config/dev/config.edn`. A blank `/config/prod/config.edn` file has been provided for production values, however other methods supported by the library, such as environment variables, can also be used.

## Supported Databases

MySQL and PostgreSQL are currently supported out-of-the-box. PostgreSQL is the default and can be changed to MySQL by editing the configuration files under the `config` directory.

## Documentation

Project documentation is generated with [Codox][] and can be found
[on GitHub Pages](https://ipavl.github.io/clorum/doc/), or generated locally by running:

    lein doc
